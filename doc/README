The project was started in 2008-2009, then on hiatus until 2013. LetkuOS is a one person project by Juho Hiltunen aka jaacoppi.

== License ==
LetkuOS is MIT-licensed. see LICENSE for details.

== Source code ==
Source code can be found from github, see git://github.com/jaacoppi/LetkuOS.

== Credits ==
the osdev community at osdev.org and #osdev (irc.freenode.org) have been a great help.

== Booting ==
Booting has only been tried on Bochs and Qemu with a grub legacy bootloader.
Currently LetkuOS needs a FAT32 file system on the first partition of the first hard drive.
