/* Page fault handler */

/* theory and some practise from JamesM, http://jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/6.-Paging.html

A cpu generates a page fault in the following situations:
1. Reading from or writing to an area of memory that is not mapped (page entry/table's 'present' flag is not set)
2. The process is in user-mode and tries to write to a read-only page.
3. The process is in user-mode and tries to access a kernel-only page.
4. The page table entry is corrupted - the reserved bits have been overwritten.

Error code meaning:
Bit 0 - If set, the fault was _not_ because the page wasn't present. If unset, the page wasn't present.
Bit 1 - If set, the operation that caused the fault was a write, else it was a read.
Bit 2 - If set, the processor was running in user-mode when it was interrupted. Else, it was running in kernel-mode.
Bit 3 - If set, the fault was caused by reserved bits being overwritten.
Bit 4 - If set, the fault occurred during an instruction fetch.
